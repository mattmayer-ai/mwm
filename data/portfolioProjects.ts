The platform generates experiments, validates hypotheses, and synthesizes learnings into decisions automatically. Users interact through a simple chat interface, describing problems in natural language. Every interaction strengthens a knowledge graph, creating a proprietary competitive advantage. Built on Spring Boot 3.x with Project Reactor backend, PostgreSQL with PGVector for semantic search, Next.js 15 and React 19 frontend with Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming, deployed via Docker with Nginx reverse proxy and Liquibase migrations.',

      "At Air Canada, pilots struggled to complete mandatory annual training due to accessibility barriers, not cost issues as leadership initially assumed. The existing LMS required desktop access and constant internet connectivity, making it impossible for pilots to train during layovers, hotel stays, or while traveling globally. This challenge led us to pioneer one of the aviation industry's first offline iPad training platforms, leveraging Air Canada's Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) rollout. Through systematic user journey optimization—reducing access from 10+ clicks to a single tap—we eliminated decision fatigue and friction points. By personally logging 697 user complaints and conducting comprehensive story mapping, we discovered that accessibility—not accuracy or cost—was the true barrier.",
