## 1) Give me your 90-second story.

I’m a product leader who ships by learning fast. My through-line is cutting time-to-insight, then turning those insights into outcomes. I’ve led zero-to-one and scale efforts across complex workflows, platforms, and AI/agent systems. My style is calm and empowering—set context, remove blockers, and let great people do the best work of their careers. If we’re shrinking TTI and improving user outcomes week over week, we’re compounding.

## 2) What’s your product philosophy in one line?

I focus on learning faster than the risk compounds. If I can reach credible insight quickly—with real users, instrumented prototypes, and tight experiments—I earn the right to build bigger.

## 3) What’s your north-star metric?

My north-star is Time-to-Insight—the time from a real question to evidence that changes a decision. I pair it with one outcome per bet (error rate, cycle time, revenue/case) so progress stays legible.

## 4) How do you set strategy for a portfolio?

I start with narrative: who the users are, their jobs-to-be-done, the bottlenecks, and the advantages we can compound. Then I name a handful of bets with continue/kill evidence, cadence, and owners. We review bi-weekly—what did we learn, what changed, what stops.

## 5) How do you decide what not to do?

I say “no” where I can’t learn fast: data is inaccessible, I can’t instrument the workflow, or prototypes can’t reach users quickly. I also pass when there’s no compounding advantage beyond a feature.

## 6) Describe your leadership style.

Empowering, direct, and steady. I set crisp context and constraints, then trust the team. I’m generous with credit, ruthless with blockers, and transparent about trade-offs. People do their best work when they feel safe, seen, and stretched.

## 7) How do you use data without becoming dogmatic?

Data informs; it doesn’t dictate. I pair telemetry and funnels with desk-side observation and interviews. When quant and qual disagree, we design an experiment to reconcile them. I won’t let a pretty dashboard overrule an obvious user pain I’ve watched firsthand.

## 8) What makes a great product review?

I run reviews with a short narrative, three screenshots, two graphs, and a decision. We revisit the question we asked, the experiment we ran, the evidence we saw, and the next move. No slide parades—just signal.

## 9) Tell me about a tough pivot.

I’ve killed initiatives I personally loved when the learning said “stop.” I explain the evidence, honor the work, and redirect talent to a bet with clearer signal. You keep trust by showing the math and moving quickly.

## 10) How do you maintain speed without burnout?

I rely on clarity, not heroics: small batches, thin slices, and unambiguous “done.” Teams burn out sprinting into fog, so I remove fog, protect focus, and celebrate learning—not late nights.

## 11) How do you run discovery?

I sit beside the work. I watch hands on keyboards, capture friction, and prototype the smallest thing that could change a week, not a quarter. I instrument it, ship to a handful of users, decide, repeat.

## 12) When do you choose AI?

I turn to AI when judgment is expensive, language is the natural interface, or messy data hides value—and only when I can prove it beats baselines on accuracy, latency, and cost-per-correct outcome.

## 13) When do you say “no” to AI?

I say “no” when it can’t beat baselines on accuracy or cost-per-correct outcome, when governance risk outweighs benefit, or when AI doesn’t deliver true value to the product or the customer’s need. I’ll ship a simpler rule if it wins.

## 14) How do you design multi-agent systems (CNS-style)?

I treat agents like teammates: each has a crisp job, shared memory, tools, and escalation paths. I orchestrate with rules first, learn where coordination fails, then upgrade selectively. I always show my work—logs, traces, decisions.

## 15) How do you measure AI quality?

I track task accuracy against ground truth, cost per correct, latency distributions, and interventions per 100 tasks. I also watch time-to-first-useful and time-to-trust-rebuild after errors.

## 16) How do you control cost without neutering capability?

I plan before I prompt. I map jobs to the smallest effective model, cache, stream, and lean on tools. I track cost-per-correct at the job level, keep a small-model path for most work, and reserve frontier models for truly hard cases.

## 17) What’s your GTM motion for a new product?

I start painfully narrow. I win one sharp use case in one segment, publish before/after outcomes, land references, then expand to adjacent workflows. Buyers buy proof, not promises.

## 18) How do you manage risk?

I name it, size it, and buy it down. Each bet keeps a risk ledger—technical, UX, data, compliance, economics—with a targeted experiment per risk. If a risk won’t buy down, we stop.

## 19) How do you prioritize?

I score by impact × confidence × time-to-insight. If two bets are close, I pick the one that teaches more. Learning compounds.

## 20) How do you build trust with execs and partners?

I keep it surprise-free: clear narratives, leading indicators, and honest trade-offs. I bring them into the learning loop (short demos, user clips, early dashboards) so they feel momentum.

## 21) How do you onboard senior hires?

I onboard with context and empowerment. Week 1: users, data, bets, guardrails. Week 2: own a thin slice end-to-end. I run a 30-60-90 around outcomes, not tasks, with weekly path-clearing so they ship something meaningful in month one.

## 22) How do you handle disagreement?

I disagree and commit—with receipts. I write the contested assumptions, run the smallest discriminating test, and let evidence decide. If it’s taste, the directly responsible owner makes the call after the room is heard.

## 23) What does “empowering leadership” look like in practice?

I give people real problems and real autonomy. I broadcast the “why,” protect the “how,” and clear blockers fast. I’m candid, I listen, and I give the win to the team. It’s steady, not loud.

## 24) How do you pick metrics that matter?

I anchor on the user’s moment of value. I choose a leading indicator and a lagging outcome, then instrument the path. Vanity metrics don’t survive a weekly review with real users.

## 25) What’s your approach to pricing?

I price the outcome, not the feature. If we reduce errors or cycle time, I price to that delta. I pilot with friendly customers, watch retention and expansion, then tune.

## 26) How do you scale a platform team?

I scale with stable primitives, paved roads, and ruthless de-duplication. I publish clear contracts and SLAs, then negotiate priorities using outcomes, not ticket queues.

## 27) How do you align design and engineering?

I plan with both disciplines in the room. Designers sit beside engineers during spikes; engineers join user sessions. Our core artifact is a story—problem, constraints, experiment, success test—not a 40-page spec.

## 28) How do you manage dependencies?

I expose them early. I keep a visible map and pull high-risk items forward. When possible, I invert the dependency—ship a thin slice that removes waiting.

## 29) How do you hire PMs?

I hire for learning velocity, taste, and credibility with builders. I hand them a messy problem and watch them clarify it, propose a thin slice, and instrument outcomes. Story + math.

## 30) What’s your bar for “done”?

For me, “done” means a user’s week looks different and the metric moved. If we only shipped code, we’re not done. If we shipped learning that changes our next move, that iteration is done.

## 31) How do you keep quality high while moving fast?

I set guardrails at the edges (security, privacy, accessibility) and give freedom in the middle. We automate regressions that burned us once. Quality lives in culture—people care because they see users win.

## 32) How do you roadmap under uncertainty?

I write the bet as a pre-mortem—how it fails, how we’d know early—then back-solve to discriminating experiments. If we can’t tell a kill story, we’re not ready to commit.

## 33) How do you work with Sales without whiplash?

I co-own a truth loop with Sales. I join key calls, hear objections firsthand, and share the experiment plan so reps know what’s real. Sales brings crisp, tagged feedback—no anecdote soup.

## 34) How do you communicate results without arrogance?

I state the baseline, the intervention, and the lift—in users’ words when possible. Confidence with specificity. Credit goes to the team.

## 35) How do you rescue a slipping initiative?

I simplify scope to the smallest proof and reset cadence: weekly experiment, Friday evidence, Monday decision. I fix ownership, kill side quests, and add help only where the bottleneck is real.

## 36) How do you ensure accessibility and inclusion?

I treat inclusion as non-negotiable. We design and test with real users across abilities, budget time for it, and bake checks into CI. Inclusion makes the product better for everyone.

## 37) How do you communicate up and out?

I use narratives, not noise. One page: the bets, the evidence, and the next three moves. Executives don’t need more charts; they need confidence the system is learning.

## 38) What’s your view on “vision”?

I treat vision as a useful constraint. It defines which hard problems are “ours” and which we gladly leave. It must be testable in slices, not just a poster.

## 39) Build vs. buy vs. partner?

I buy for speed when differentiation is low, build when we can earn compounding advantage, and partner when distribution or trust is the bottleneck. I revisit as facts change.

## 40) How do you run post-mortems?

I run them blameless, fast, and useful. I capture the chain of events, the missing guardrails, and one change per layer (people, process, tooling). We make the changes and check back in 30 days.

## 41) How do you choose metrics for a new feature?

I start at the moment of value. I pick one leading and one lagging metric, then instrument the path. If we can’t measure it, we’re not ready to ship broadly.

## 42) Security & privacy with AI?

I enforce least-privilege access, data minimization, and clear retention rules. We red-team for prompt injection and data exfiltration. If we can’t explain the risk posture plainly, we don’t ship.

## 43) How do you keep engineers close to users?

I bring engineers into discovery and bring users into our tools (recordings, traces, sandboxes). Nothing aligns a team faster than watching a user struggle—or succeed—with our work.

## 44) How do you avoid pilot purgatory?

I set exit criteria before the pilot. Pilots end with buy/no-buy tied to agreed outcomes, not “let’s extend.” If outcomes are ambiguous, I rerun with cleaner design—or stop.

## 45) How do you keep momentum across teams?

I keep momentum through shared rituals with real artifacts: demo day, a visible bets board, and a “wins” reel showing users’ lives changing. Momentum is a feeling—so I make it visible.

## 46) How do you choose your own next bets?

I go where I can shrink TTI the most—untangling ambiguity, unlocking data, aligning partners. I’ll take the hard first mile, then hand it to the team.

## 47) What’s your coaching approach?

I coach to strengths. I set one growth edge, run deliberate reps, and celebrate progress. The goal is sharper judgment, clearer storytelling, and stronger follow-through.

## 48) A recent decision you’re proud of?

I shut down a “good” idea early because the learning didn’t support it. We saved quarters of burn and redirected to a bet that paid users immediately. I’m proud of the honesty and the pivot.

## 49) What should we remember about you?

Calm in ambiguity, fast to learn, relentless about outcomes. I’ll set a clear strategy, create safety and speed for the team, and keep our compass on Time-to-Insight so we win by thinking and acting faster than the risk.

## 50) What would your first 90 days look like here?

Days 0–30: I sit beside users, map the workflow, instrument the funnel, and publish a simple strategy doc with 3–5 named bets and success evidence. Days 31–60: I ship two thin slices that measurably improve a painful step; I set weekly learning cadence and shared dashboards. Days 61–90: I expand the two wins, kill one lower-signal path, and lock a quarterly plan that pairs TTI targets with outcome targets. You’ll feel momentum—and see it—in the metrics and the work.
