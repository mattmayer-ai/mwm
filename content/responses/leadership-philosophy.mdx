My leadership philosophy centers on building coalitions through individual value propositions while maintaining unified product vision. I don't believe in mandating cooperation—instead, I create specific, measurable value for each stakeholder.

**The Air Canada example:** When building the iPad training platform, I orchestrated 6 departments (HR, Finance, IT, DevOps, Training, C-suite) by giving Finance cost savings metrics, Training efficiency improvements, and pilots accessibility benefits. Everyone saw their own win while contributing to a shared outcome.

**Core principles:**

• **Empowerment over control:** Set crisp context and constraints, then trust the team. I'm generous with credit, ruthless with blockers, and transparent about trade-offs.

• **Psychological safety:** People do their best work when they feel safe, seen, and stretched. Disagreement drives better decisions, not conflict.

• **Communication repetition:** I focus on communicating vision, repeating it 10 times more than I think necessary to ensure alignment.

• **Quick wins:** Generating quick, visible wins is crucial to build momentum and celebrate early adopters of new initiatives.

• **Data-informed, not data-driven:** I pair telemetry with desk-side observation and interviews. When quant and qual disagree, we design experiments to reconcile them.

This approach has become my template for driving organizational change, successfully applied across aviation, defense, and technology sectors with teams ranging from 6 to 50+ members.
