Here's how I approach my first 90 days in a new role:

**Days 1-30: Listen and Learn**
• Map the organization: Who are the key stakeholders? What are their individual incentives and pain points?
• Understand the product portfolio: What's working? What's not? Where are the bottlenecks?
• Review data: Telemetry, user feedback, support tickets, financial metrics. But also get out and observe.
• Identify quick wins: What can I unblock or accelerate in the first month to build credibility?

**Days 31-60: Build Coalitions**
• Create individual value propositions: Finance gets cost metrics, Operations gets efficiency, Product gets innovation signals.
• Establish North Star metrics: One metric that matters, aligned with business value.
• Set up experimentation framework: How will we learn faster than risk compounds?
• Remove blockers: What's slowing the team down? What dependencies can I break?

**Days 61-90: Execute and Iterate**
• Ship something meaningful: A feature, a process improvement, a strategic pivot—something that demonstrates the new approach.
• Run first strategic review: What did we learn? What changed? What stops?
• Establish cadence: Weekly reviews, bi-weekly strategic check-ins, quarterly planning.
• Build momentum: Celebrate wins, share learnings, create a culture of rapid iteration.

**My signature move:** At Swift Racks, I personally logged 697 complaints at Air Canada to identify root problems. I'll do whatever it takes to understand the real user pain, not just what the dashboard says.

The goal isn't to have all the answers by day 90—it's to have established a system for learning and executing that compounds over time.
