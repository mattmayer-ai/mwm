## Capstone Project {#sec-capstone}

The Capstone Project challenges participants to think and act like product leaders, driving innovation and market readiness at every stage. Over six weeks, students work collaboratively in small teams to:

- Ideate innovative product concepts rooted in creativity and problem-solving, utilizing real-world insights to validate ideas and identify opportunities
- Refine and validate market fit, ensuring that the product's value proposition aligns with customer needs through targeted research and feedback
- Leverage Swift Racks' proven methodologies to guide the product development process, from ideation and strategy to actionable execution plans
- Integrate Go-To-Market (GTM) strategies, aligning product vision and development efforts with a clear plan for customer acquisition and launch success
- Pitch their product, demonstrating a clear understanding of its value proposition, market fit, and GTM plan

**Project Structure:**
- **Week 1:** Ideation & Team Formation - Define team roles and select a product idea aligned with identified market gaps
- **Week 2:** Continuous Discovery - Conduct user research to validate assumptions and define the problem statement
- **Week 3:** Strategy Development - Develop a product vision and roadmap to guide your journey
- **Week 4:** Design & Development - Create user personas, build prototypes, and draft technical requirements
- **Week 5:** Go-to-Market - Finalize your launch plan, aligning sales, marketing, and product teams
- **Week 6:** Final Presentation - Present your product's journey from concept to launch, showcasing the value it brings to users

**Deliverables:** By Week 6, each team presents a pitch deck including a problem statement and target audience analysis, strategic product vision and roadmap, prototypes and usability testing insights, and a go-to-market strategy designed for scalability and impact.

## Signature Frameworks {#sec-frameworks}

**The Assumption-to-Experiment Pipeline** systematizes how we move from ideas to validated learning. Students learn to identify critical assumptions, rank them by impact and uncertainty, form falsifiable hypotheses, design minimal viable experiments, and synthesize learnings into decisions. This framework comes directly from Swift Racks' innovation methodology [ref:7][ref:8].

**Customer Journey Optimization** teaches the distinction between the "moment of intrigue" and the "aha moment." Using TakeCost's journey inversion as the canonical example, students learn to identify where users first understand potential value versus where they commit. The framework emphasizes delivering value before demanding commitment [ref:4][ref:5].

**The 70% Friction Reduction Method** derived from my Air Canada experience, teaches systematic friction identification and elimination. Students learn journey mapping, click-counting, decision point analysis, and progressive simplification. The goal: reduce any critical user path by at least 70% [ref:3].

**Cross-Functional Coalition Building** addresses the reality that product managers must influence without authority. Using examples from Air Canada (6 departments) and RaceRocks (multiple security clearances), students learn to create individual value propositions for each stakeholder while maintaining unified product vision [ref:3][ref:9].

## Student Outcomes & Feedback {#sec-feedback}

Students consistently report that the practical focus and real-world cases make abstract concepts tangible. One recent graduate now working at a Toronto fintech wrote: "The assumption-to-experiment pipeline you taught is literally how I run product development now. It's saved us from building three features nobody wanted" [ref:8].

The emphasis on systematic discovery resonates particularly strongly. A student currently at RBC mentioned: "I used to jump straight to solutions. Now I spend a week in discovery before writing a single requirement. The 697 complaints story changed how I think about user research" [ref:3].

Industry placement rates for students who complete all six modules exceed 85%, with many joining product teams at major Canadian enterprises. Several have started their own ventures using the Swift Racks innovation framework as their operational methodology [ref:7][ref:8].

The cross-functional coalition building framework has proven especially valuable. Students regularly mention using it during job interviews to demonstrate sophisticated thinking about stakeholder management. One student reported it was the deciding factor in landing a senior PM role: "I mapped out how I'd build coalition across their seven departments. They said it was the most sophisticated answer they'd heard" [ref:3].
