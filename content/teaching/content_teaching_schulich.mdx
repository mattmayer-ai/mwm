## Courses & Modules {#sec-courses}

I teach product management principles at Schulich School of Business, focusing on practical application over theoretical frameworks. The curriculum spans three core modules that reflect my industry experience [ref:1][ref:2].

**Module 1: Introduction to Product Management** covers the evolution from feature factories to outcome-driven organizations. Students learn to distinguish between outputs and outcomes, understand the role of product management in different organizational contexts, and practice stakeholder management across complex ecosystems. We use my Air Canada case study to demonstrate how 697 complaints became strategic insights [ref:2][ref:3].

**Module 2: Customer Discovery & Validation** teaches systematic approaches to understanding user problems before building solutions. Students practice user interview techniques, assumption mapping, and hypothesis formation. The TakeCost case serves as our primary example of how invalid assumptions can misdirect entire product strategies [ref:4][ref:5].

**Module 3: Design & Development** bridges product strategy with execution. Students learn rapid prototyping, MVP definition, and experimentation frameworks. We use the Swift CNS platform as a live case study, with students designing actual experiments that we run in production [ref:6][ref:7].

## Signature Frameworks {#sec-frameworks}

**The Assumption-to-Experiment Pipeline** systematizes how we move from ideas to validated learning. Students learn to identify critical assumptions, rank them by impact and uncertainty, form falsifiable hypotheses, design minimal viable experiments, and synthesize learnings into decisions. This framework comes directly from Swift Racks' innovation methodology [ref:7][ref:8].

**Customer Journey Optimization** teaches the distinction between the "moment of intrigue" and the "aha moment." Using TakeCost's journey inversion as the canonical example, students learn to identify where users first understand potential value versus where they commit. The framework emphasizes delivering value before demanding commitment [ref:4][ref:5].

**The 70% Friction Reduction Method** derived from my Air Canada experience, teaches systematic friction identification and elimination. Students learn journey mapping, click-counting, decision point analysis, and progressive simplification. The goal: reduce any critical user path by at least 70% [ref:3].

**Cross-Functional Coalition Building** addresses the reality that product managers must influence without authority. Using examples from Air Canada (6 departments) and RaceRocks (multiple security clearances), students learn to create individual value propositions for each stakeholder while maintaining unified product vision [ref:3][ref:9].

## Favorite Case Exercises {#sec-cases}

**The Boeing VR Failure Analysis** uses my RaceRocks VR oxygen mask trainer project to teach constraint validation. Students must identify why a technically perfect solution failed and propose alternative approaches. This case teaches that innovation alone isn't enough—timing, technical maturity, and constraint validation matter equally [ref:10].

**The RAS Simulator Reframing** challenges students to transform a simple request ("build us a training simulator") into a breakthrough innovation. Using the Replenishment at Sea case, students practice problem reframing, constraint analysis, and solution space expansion. The exercise demonstrates how the best solutions often come from challenging the initial problem statement [ref:9].

**The EdPal Pivot Workshop** gives students real user interview data from homeschool families and asks them to identify the pivot opportunity. They must recognize that parents' 3-5 hour weekly lesson planning burden matters more than VR lab access, then design an AI-powered solution. This exercise uses actual Swift Racks data from our July 2025 pivot [ref:11][ref:12].

## Student Outcomes & Feedback {#sec-outcomes}

Students consistently report that the practical focus and real-world cases make abstract concepts tangible. One recent graduate now working at a Toronto fintech wrote: "The assumption-to-experiment pipeline you taught is literally how I run product development now. It's saved us from building three features nobody wanted" [ref:8].

The emphasis on systematic discovery resonates particularly strongly. A student currently at RBC mentioned: "I used to jump straight to solutions. Now I spend a week in discovery before writing a single requirement. The 697 complaints story changed how I think about user research" [ref:3].

Industry placement rates for students who complete all three modules exceed 85%, with many joining product teams at major Canadian enterprises. Several have started their own ventures using the Swift Racks innovation framework as their operational methodology [ref:7][ref:8].

The cross-functional coalition building framework has proven especially valuable. Students regularly mention using it during job interviews to demonstrate sophisticated thinking about stakeholder management. One student reported it was the deciding factor in landing a senior PM role: "I mapped out how I'd build coalition across their seven departments. They said it was the most sophisticated answer they'd heard" [ref:3].
