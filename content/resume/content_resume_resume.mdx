# Summary

**Head of Product | AI/LLM Implementation Expert | Strategic Innovation Leader**

I architect product strategies that turn organizational chaos into competitive advantage. Over 14+ years, I've pioneered digital transformations across aviation, defense, and enterprise sectors—from building the world's first offline pilot training platform to developing AI-powered systems that have generated $20M+ in operational savings.

My approach centers on systematic customer discovery, cross-functional coalition building, and responsible AI implementation that drives measurable business outcomes. Currently leading AI platform development at Swift Racks while teaching product management at Schulich, I specialize in zero-to-one product development that transforms how organizations operate and compete.

**The moment that defined my approach to product leadership happened in 2012 at Air Canada.** I was managing pilot training systems—overseeing an LMS platform that every flight crew member depended on for mandatory training. But the system was failing, and I needed to understand why.

So I did something unconventional: I made myself the sole point of contact for all LMS issues for an entire year, personally logging 697 complaints. Not just tickets—stories, frustrations, patterns.

While leadership saw a cost problem, the data revealed an access crisis. Our pilots were flying globally across time zones with irregular schedules, yet our LMS assumed they were sitting at desks. We'd built an office worker solution for people who lived in airports and aircraft.

Then came the breakthrough: Air Canada was rolling out Electronic Flight Bags—iPads replacing paper charts for every pilot. We didn't just see technology deployment; we saw transformation opportunity. Our vision: "Training. Anywhere. Anytime."

We built one of the world's first offline training platforms with auto-sync capabilities. But during user testing, a critical flaw emerged—it still required 10+ clicks to start training. For pilots logging in once yearly, that was 9 clicks too many. Through systematic journey mapping, we discovered the real moment of value: simply starting the first required course. We restructured everything—intelligent auto-assignment, eliminated decision points, clarity over complexity.

The transformation: 70% friction reduction, one-tap training access, complaints dropped to near zero, plus $1.5 million in annual cost savings.

But more importantly, this was my evolution from 'Manage' to strategic product leader. I learned that true product management isn't about building what's requested—it's about discovering what's actually needed and transforming how people work.

This experience established my core philosophy: deep customer empathy combined with systematic data analysis creates breakthrough solutions that others miss.

# Core Skills

**AI/ML Product Leadership:** Architected multi-agent AI systems using AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 3.7) with orchestrator-workers pattern, GPT-4 integration, and computer vision via Scale AI labeled datasets. Established responsible AI governance frameworks covering bias testing, transparency, and performance monitoring. Built RAG implementations using PGVector and PostgreSQL vector extensions for semantic search, achieving 85% processing efficiency improvements. Technical stack includes Spring Boot 3.x with Project Reactor backend, Next.js 15 and React 19 frontend with Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming, Docker containerization, Nginx reverse proxy, and Liquibase migrations [ref:1][ref:5].

**Strategic Planning & Roadmapping:** Served on RaceRocks strategy committee for 4 consecutive years, developing 3-5 year roadmaps and annual strategic initiatives. Transformed Swift Racks from operational chaos to structured execution through North Star metrics and quarterly strategic reviews [ref:6].

**Experimentation & Data Insights:** Developed systematic frameworks from idea to assumption to experiment, including AI-powered experiment selection using criteria matrices. Personally logged 697 user complaints at Air Canada to identify root problems. Conducted comprehensive user research pivoting entire product strategies [ref:2][ref:7].

**Cross-Functional Leadership:** Orchestrated teams across 6+ departments at Air Canada (HR, Finance, IT, DevOps, Training, C-suite). Managed globally distributed defense teams with different security clearances. Currently building product teams while teaching at Schulich [ref:2][ref:3][ref:8].
