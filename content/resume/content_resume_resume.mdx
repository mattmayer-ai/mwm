# Summary

I bring 11+ years of product management expertise and 15+ years in systems integration, specializing in transforming complex organizational challenges into measurable business outcomes. Currently Head of Product at Swift Racks, I lead development of enterprise AI platforms including our CNS innovation copilot, achieving $1.8M recurring revenue growth and 85% operational efficiency improvements [ref:1].

My career spans regulated industries from aviation to defense, where I've consistently delivered zero-to-one products under mission-critical constraints. At Air Canada, I pioneered one of the industry's first offline iPad training platforms, reducing friction by 70% and saving $1.5M annually [ref:2]. At RaceRocks, I developed the world's first integrated Replenishment at Sea simulator, delivering $20M+ in operational savings [ref:3].

I distinguish myself through systematic experimentation and customer journey optimization, teaching these principles at Schulich School of Business while actively building AI-powered solutions using GPT-4 and Claude models. My approach centers on three core strengths: leading with data-driven insights, orchestrating cross-functional teams across complex stakeholder ecosystems, and implementing go-to-market strategies that deliver rapid time-to-value [ref:1][ref:4].

# Core Skills

**AI/ML Product Leadership:** Architected multi-agent AI systems using AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 3.7), GPT-4, and computer vision. Established responsible AI governance frameworks covering bias testing, transparency, and performance monitoring.
